So, you need following guides by [James A. Chambers](https://jamesachambers.com/)
- [StarFive VisionFive 2 Firmware / Bootloader Update Guide][guide-firmware]
- [StarFive VisionFive 2 Official Debian SSD Boot Guide][guide-ssd]


:::tip

Booting from old image can result in errorneus RAM size display, don't be afraid seeing 4GB instead of 8GB.
If you follow this article, this should not happen, but anyway.

:::

## Firmware update

You can't install new images without updating your firmware.

### Download firmware

To do this, get `sdcard.img`, `visionfive2_fw_payload.img` and `u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out`  from [Vision2 v2.10.4 Release][release].

:::caution

Latest version can prevent you from booting, try `v2.10.4` if you have any issues.

:::

```
wget https://github.com/starfive-tech/VisionFive2/releases/download/VF2_v2.10.4/{sdcard.img,visionfive2_fw_payload.img,u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out}
```

### Prepare SD card

Then, flash it with [balenaEtcher][balena] to your SD card:

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('./img/blog/2023-03/balena.png')}/>

[release]: https://github.com/starfive-tech/VisionFive2/releases/tag/VF2_v2.10.4
[balena]: https://www.balena.io/etcher

Copy  `visionfive2_fw_payload.img` and `u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out` to the `/root` of your SD card `rootfs`, so you can access them later without
setting up ftp servers.

### Boot

Insert the SD card into the VisionFive 2 and power it on. After minute or two, you should see flashing green light on the board.
On connected monitor you should see the load progress. There will be no GUI or console, so you need to connect to the board via SSH.

Use `root` as username and `starfive` as password.

### Flash firmware

As per [guide][guide-firmware], you need to install `mtd-utils` and flash the firmware:

```
apt update && apt install mtd-utils -y
```

```
sudo flashcp -v u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out /dev/mtd0
sudo flashcp -v visionfive2_fw_payload.img /dev/mtd1
```


## Install Debian

### Download image

Download image from [download page][download]. I've used `202302` image from Google Drive.
You can use my [magnet link][magnet], but make sure to check hashes.

Flash to SD card with [balenaEtcher][balena] and boot.

:::info

Use `root` username, `starfive` password. First login will fail, just try again.
GUI can freeze, just press restart button.

:::

:::caution

There is no SSH server by default, you should use GUI.

:::

To install ssh server, run:

```bash
apt-get install -y openssh-server
```

### Updating

:::caution

GUI can be broken after update, so make sure that SSH server is working.

:::

System can be outdated (probably is fixed in `202303` image), you should download new keyring and upgrade:

```
wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/debian-ports-archive-keyring/debian-ports-archive-keyring_2023.02.01_all.deb
dpkg -i debian-ports-archive-keyring_2023.02.01_all.deb
```

Edit your sources.list:
```
$ nano /etc/apt/sources.list
deb https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian-ports/20230316T202809Z unstable main
```

After that, you can update your system:
```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

This can take some time.

## SSD


### Backup

:::tip

Backup your data from SD card, this will save your time. You don't want to setup ssh server and wait for apt again, if something fails.

:::

Shutdown your devboard (`systemctl halt`) remove SD card and create a backup:

```
sudo dd if=/dev/sde of=backup.img
```

See [that article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1174487/re-size-the-img-for-smaller-sd-card-how-to-shrink-a-bootable-sd-card-image)
how to shrink resulting image.

### Copy partitions

Refer to original [guide][guide-ssd].

:::caution

Find a valid `root` partition first. The `mmcblk1p3` can be not a root.

:::

To find a partition, use `blkid`:

```
blkid | grep root
```
```
/dev/mmcblk1p4: LABEL="root" UUID="44d3144d-069b-4e11-b6b4-68c296328a12" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="c3a2885b-b39c-b54d-b8fa-eac6faccbed8"
```

So, in that case you should use `/dev/mmcblk1p4` and `/dev/nvme0n1p4` instead of `/dev/mmcblk1p3` and `/dev/nvme0n1p3` in the guide!

### Fix extlinux.conf

You probably should update this file on both SSD and SD:
```
mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt/boot/
```

Note the `mmcblk1p4` and `nvme0n1p4` should be your `root` partitions (`blkid | grep root`).
```
sed -i 's/mmcblk1p4/nvme0n1p4/g' /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
sed -i 's/mmcblk1p4/nvme0n1p4/g' /mnt/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
```

Also don't forget to follow guide and generate new UUID for SD card `root` partition:
```
tune2fs -O metadata_csum_seed -U random /dev/mmcblk1p4
```

You probably want to resize your SSD partition:

```
e2fsck -f /dev/nvme0n4p
```

To do this, use `fdisk`. Delete your `root` partiton (`d`) and re-add it (`n`):
```
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

After that, run `e2fsck -f /dev/nvme0n4p` again and `resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p4` to resize partition.

To be sure, run `e2fsck` again.
