ClickHouse uses **one of previous** versions of [CityHash from Google](https://github.com/google/cityhash).

Current version of Google's CityHash **differs** from ClickHouse variant.

You can use [go-faster/city](https://github.com/go-faster/city) Go package that implements both variants.

Also see [Introducing CityHash](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/04/introducing-cityhash.html) for description and
reasoning behind creation. TL;DR **non-cryptographic** hash that is faster than [MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), but more complex.
