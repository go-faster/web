ClickHouse uses **one of previous** versions of [CityHash from Google](https://github.com/google/cityhash).

:::info
CityHash has changed the algorithm after we have added it into ClickHouse.

CityHash documentation specifically notes that the user should not rely to specific hash values and should not save it anywhere or use it as sharding key.

But as we exposed this function to the user, we had to fix the version of CityHash (to 1.0.2). And now we guarantee that the behaviour of CityHash functions available in SQL will not change.

:::danger Note

Current version of Google's CityHash [differs](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/8354) from ClickHouse `cityHash64` variant.

Don't use `farmHash64` to get Google's CityHash value! [FarmHash](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2014/03/introducing-farmhash.html) is a successor to CityHash, but they are not fully compatible.

You can use [go-faster/city](https://github.com/go-faster/city) Go package that implements both variants.

Also see [Introducing CityHash](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/04/introducing-cityhash.html) for description and
reasoning behind creation. TL;DR **non-cryptographic** hash that is faster than [MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), but more complex.

## Examples

Let's take 64-bit hash from `Moscow` string.

```sql
:) SELECT cityHash64('Moscow')
12507901496292878638
```
```

```go
s := []byte("Moscow")
fmt.Print("ClickHouse: ")
fmt.Println(city.CH64(s))
fmt.Print("CityHash:   ")
fmt.Println(city.Hash64(s))
// Output:
// ClickHouse: 12507901496292878638
// CityHash:   5992710078453357409
```

You can use [test data corpus](https://github.com/go-faster/city/blob/main/_testdata/data.json) to check your implementation of ClickHouse CityHash variant if needed.
It has the following format, where uint128 values are represented by base64std encoded big endian byte slices.
