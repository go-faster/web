We are building [ClickHouse Client](https://github.com/go-faster/ch) that uses binary protocol and talks to server by TCP.

There is no reference for binary protocol, so we've decided to create one.

## Implementations

We've used C++ and Python implementations as reference.

* [C++ client](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp)
* [Python client](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver)
