We are building [ClickHouse Client](https://github.com/go-faster/ch) that uses binary protocol and talks to server by TCP.

There is no reference for binary protocol, so we've decided to create one.

:::info
Documentation is still under construction, but [our go implementation](https://github.com/go-faster/ch/tree/main/proto)
fully implements protocol (bot server and client side) with necessary test vectors.
:::

## Implementations

We've used C++, Python and Go implementations as reference.

* [Official Go client](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go)
* [C++ client](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp)
* [Python client](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver)
